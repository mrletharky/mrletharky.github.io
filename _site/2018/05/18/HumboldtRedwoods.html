        <p>I was invited to go camping in the Humboldt Redwoods State Park with my housemate, D, and her club. Initially, I was hesitant because I don’t do well with bugs, however I am a huge admirer of nature and the unknown beauty it holds to the common eye. And I have always wanted to go camping.</p>

<p>May 11th.
My biologist friend and housemate, N, and I started our drive up to Humboldt around 5pm. After multiple delays with packing and extra gear, we finally got on the road. We drove through cities I have never seen or heard of before. Most of which looked shabby and run down to my bougie-conditioned eye. The houses looked very country, middle-of-nowhere to me, but there was a calming vibe to their simplicity.</p>

<p>We arrived at the campsite around 10:30-11pm, and it was so dark. We had no clue which campsite was ours or even the proper way to maneuver through the campground. Eventually we found D’s car and parked behind her. The joy on her face at our arrival made the long trip even better, despite the loss of phone service. The group had a campfire going and it was really nice, considering how cold it felt.</p>

<p>May 12th.
N and I woke up SO early. We went to bed around midnight, but got out of our tent and started walking around at 5:30am. We just couldn’t sleep. It was truly a struggle. I also was freezing because I was using D’s summer sleeping bag, which was really lightweight. And…I was too lazy and tired to actually put on more layers. My bad.
Since we woke up hours before everyone else, we made breakfast and took a look around our campground. We checked out the visitor center and all the interesting facts they posted. And afterwards, we found a river trail from our campground that went straight to what seems to be part of Eel Creek. It was beautiful, especially since the sun was finally shining through the trees. I found a tiny frog on a rock by the stream, and it was so adorable. N studies frogs for his research. This one was apparently a Foothill Yellow-Legged frog. N caught it and I got the chance to see it up close. We also found four masses of frog eggs nearby. They were like mini boba balls. In that same sitting, we saw two garter snakes. N couldn’t catch them, but it was pretty amazing to see them swim and make their way around the rocks and plants.</p>

<p>After our rept-phibian (reptile/amphibian) discovery, we went back to our campsite to tell our group about our find (around 10am). Everyone was excited to come along. We skipped rocks and some even kissed frogs. It was a really enjoyable experience to see how everyone interacts, and what they found to be fun.</p>

<p>Shortly after our group creek journey, we decided to go on the trail with the 13 oldest redwoods toward Bull Creek…something like that. Either way, it was a long trail and there were so many fallen redwoods. It was beautiful though. I was initially withdrawn, as is my personality, especially in new groups. But I eventually opened up. Found myself talking to two new people. One of which, I really enjoyed her company and her view on the outdoors. After talking to her, I opened up a lot more. We had a nice lunch by a stream, then made some stops at a few more groves on the way back to our campsite. This was a day full of learning and observation for me.</p>

<p>May 13th.
A trip has to end at some point, and this was the day. Everyone had school the next day, so it obviously had to be cut short. N and I woke up really early again, but we slept really well so that was good. N and I were ready to go! After our fellow campers woke up and packed our gear, we all set out in our separate ways. N and I followed D, and the campers in her car, to different groves on our way back to where we call home. She made a detour though. And we found ourself going from the 101 all the way to Highway 1. It was my first time driving along it on the coast. It was beautiful. It really made me realize how much I should tell people I appreciate them, because D was really trying to make my first camping trip incredible. And it truly was. We had burgers at Jenny’s Giant Burger in Fort Bragg. It was pretty good, but I wish I got a double because I felt so damn hungry.</p>

<p>A few more hours go by and we’re back at the house. I finally conceded to directly answering N’s and D’s questions about how I felt about the trip. Yes, I had fun. Yes, I would do it again.</p>

<p>What I find interesting is that they asked me these questions as if I never wanted to go camping. Yes, I am scared to death of spiders, and no, I haven’t been camping. But it was never because I didn’t want to go. It was due to my lack of accessibility. Camping is expensive. The campsite we went to was $35 per day. And the gear…I don’t even want to know. Firewood was $8 per bundle. When I was younger, my family could not afford it. Nor did we have the time to actually do it. My mom was working all the time. I only remember seeing her early in the morning when she dropped us off at school, or late at night when she came home after work. We either walked back home, had a babysitter pick us up, or she picked us up late from daycare. There was no time or resources to even try camping. At school, there were camping field trips, but even then, we still couldn’t afford the base fee to even join.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m greatly appreciative of the opportunity I had this past weekend, but I cannot stress enough the importance of accessibility, particularly in regards to more expensive activities. There is a divide in group demographic on trips like these because some people simply do not have access, and those who do have the resources may not realize that it’s not from the lack of desire that it doesn’t happen.</p>
