        <p>I’m queer. And the person I’m talking to is sort of out, as bisexual. I say sort of because she’s out to some, but not all. Her family being in the not all category. There are two Instagram accounts that she uses, one is accessible to a few select people (ie. close friends), and the other is for public viewing. I am following both.</p>

<p>Here is where the division of expectation and reality clashes for me. By expectation, it’s a hope. On her public Instagram, her family has access to her posts. This is where she posts photos of her friends, teammates, and family. My hope is that I could be on there with her, not even as her S/O, but just as a friend. Instead, I’m put on her private Instagram, where only her friends follow. Which is fine. Don’t get me wrong. I’m surprised that she’d even post anything about me, but the private vs public Instagram makes me feel like some things mean more that they’d be posted publicly.</p>

<p>Being part of the private post, I feel like I’m a part of her life that has to be hidden. I understand that some things cannot be shared, in regards to non-heteronormative behavior, considering that there is so much ignorance and discrimination in the world. But sometimes I feel like she could be ashamed of me, since she posted pictures of my friends on her public Instagram, that I’m the person that has to be hidden in the closet. Or that I’m not seen as a good enough friend to be worth introducing to family…</p>

<p>I’m probably being overly sensitive about this though. I should accept what I get, I guess.</p>
