        <p>This web project of mine was first conceived with the idea that I would develop my HTML and CSS skills. Considering that this site is powered by Jekyll, I have also decided to understand the basic workings of it, at the very least.</p>

<p>To maintain my motivation in improving my technological skills, I have decided to blog about various things that occur in my life. These things may also include personal information, events or places I go, products I buy, or even random thoughts I have.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s see how this goes.</p>
