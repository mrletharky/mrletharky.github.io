      <p>Ok, I was really hoping not to vent on here (especially so soon), but I’m really frustrated.</p>

<p>I am a quiet person, who typically doesn’t share their opinions unless asked. However, today, when the person I am dating mentioned an instance, in which a mutual friend was being rude and insistent, I was livid! I found out that this friend was asking my girl (she doesn’t know that I call her that sometimes..) to do things for her that they could full well do themselves, and they had enough time to do it as well. It was a demand, not even a polite request.</p>

<p>After hearing of the situation, I shared my opinion with my girl, and said that she shouldn’t do as our friend commanded, especially because she had her own schedule to keep up with. She seemed to acknowledge my opinion, but didn’t follow with it, which is fine. It was her decision to make.</p>

<p>What really messed me up (trying not to cuss here), was that when one of my housemates heard about the situation, she was just as livid and voiced her opinion (aligned with mine), but she was listened to!! What in the world?! She and I said literally the same thing! “Don’t do what they said!!” And yet, my housemate is listened to. It feels as if my opinion or thought does not matter. The major difference between my housemate and I is the fact that she is significantly more outspoken than I am.</p>

<p>Is my general silence a sign for everyone to ignore me and the thoughts I want to share for once?</p>

<p>What makes someone more worthy of being listened to?</p>
