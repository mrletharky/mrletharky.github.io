        <p>Netflix apparently first released the <em>Chef’s Table</em> docuseries in 2015. I started watching it today. Literally 3 hours ago. Y’all don’t know how much I love food. Y’all don’t even know how much I love art. So the combination of the two, in regards to the videography of the food itself, touches my soul. Thanks for introducing this series to me, DK.</p>

<p>The first episode I saw was on <a href="https://n-naka.com">N/Naka</a> in Los Angeles.
  There was this strange feeling of synchronicity when I saw this episode because I observed so much Japanese culture in the two days so far. I watched a Taiko drum performance by the group, Yamato, and shortly after, I ate ramen. I even talked about wanting to eat sushi at least three times before I saw her feature as a chef. There was simply so much surrounding Japan in my life for the past few days.
Back on topic though, the highlight on N/Naka was incredible. Niki Nakayama’s account of her career and journey as a blossoming chef, and her approach towards modernizing kaiseki blew my mind. To appreciate nature as it comes, seasonally and locally…the way she expressed it was so pure and I truly admire the focus on appreciating the moment - the experience, the people, the food - life.</p>

<p>Next we saw Dan Barber of <a href="https://www.bluehillfarm.com/team/dan-barber">Blue Hill</a> in New York. What I enjoyed most about his farm-to-table focus was his initial farming process - the health of the grass. The grass needs nutrients from cows, which would be spread around by chickens. But it goes even further where goats would impede the encroaching forests. The interconnectedness was such a wondrous thought. I loved how Dan collaborated with multiple different ingredient farmers. His interest in every individual component of the meal intrigues me. I really feel for his curiosity. The energy you put into nurturing the earth for good food will result in good food. The reliance on using seasonal foods and reducing food waste definitely enforces the value I received from my mom - promote sustainability.</p>

<p>I am only a few minutes into the piece on Nancy Silverton, but I have a great respect for her diligence in searching for the best methods in doing, and finding the best blend of ingredients. The attention to the crumbs, fermentation bubbles, or even the oven spray - the details. Undergoing many trials without faltering, the effort is what I believe breeds success.</p>

<p>I have always seen food as art. And have appreciated the aesthetic appeal and effort that chefs put into creating their dish, but the way every shot, in these episodes, was taken…just adds to the beauty, in my opinion. Because you get to see the way in which these chefs, these artists, deliberately place every ingredient. It’s utterly beautiful. I can’t wait to see more chefs-d’oeuvre culinaires.</p>
