        <p>My Spring Break began at 3pm on Friday, March 23, 2018. It also marked the end of my time as an undergraduate. I was relieved to be finally done, but I was worried at the same time, because I still don’t know what will happen to me. I don’t have a job that will allow me to survive. I don’t want to ask my mom for help, financially. And I still want to learn. There are so many classes I didn’t get to take during undergrad that I really want to. Aside from my uneasiness of my unknown future, I spent my “spring break” with my girl, mostly. And my housemates sometimes.</p>

<p>It was really great so far. We were lazy for the first two days or so, staying in bed, watching Netflix, hanging out on the couch with the cat. I would say it was well-deserved. One of the days we went to the library and read in the park. It was beautiful. It wasn’t too cold, and laying out in the sun together made everything feel peaceful.</p>

<p>However, the fact that we’ve been called relationship goals by two different people (who do not know one another) over the course of two days kind of gives me life. Mostly because I don’t see it, but also because it’s interesting to think of what other people find desirable.</p>

<p>On Monday (March 26th), we planned an entire day since we’re horrible at keeping up with possible things to do, especially if we try to play it by ear. So on Tuesday, we went to the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento, with DK. It was so much fun. Ugh, I LOVE museums. I love walking around and looking at various works of art from different time periods and cultures, in different mediums and styles. Even the way the museum is designed, separate from the actual pieces, gives me so much joy. We got some cute pictures. My girl kept avoiding the camera, but sneakily took pictures of me. Too much.</p>

<p>After the museum, we headed back home and my girl got a piercing. She looks so freakin’ beautiful. She can make anything look good on her. Sorry, fangirl-ing over here. We bought movie tickets for the late showing of <em>Unsane</em> before the piercing. The trailer looked pretty interesting. But we were going to see <em>Love, Simon</em> before that movie. My girl and I met up with some other friends of mine at the theater for <em>Love, Simon</em>, and by the time the movie was over…bawling or at least sucking back tears. So relatable, it kills. I really want to rewatch it without them there, but for the first viewing, I’d give it a 4.5 if not a 5.</p>

<p>But here is where the fun begins…When my girl and I got to the theater for <em>Love, Simon</em>, we realized that neither of us had the tickets we had bought for <em>Unsane</em> on us. We lost them! How could we lose tickets that we had bought, literally, 2 hours before?! We were running through our day since we sat down. Our memory of those tickets ended right after we bought them. Wracking our brains after the movie was over still didn’t help. In the end, we decided to just see what happens. We’ll ask if they can check security tapes…anything. Worse comes to worse, we’ll buy it again. Got some frozen yogurt before the showing - blue cotton candy &lt;3</p>

<p>DK went with us to see <em>Unsane</em>, and luckily she was also the one to ask if they could check the tapes for us actually buying the tickets. And guess what? We got in!! We didn’t have to pay again, it was great. When we walked in to our seats…deadass empty. Not a soul in there. I initially attributed it to us being 30 minutes early, and spring break so everyone probably went home. But even when the trailers started, there was a total of about 10 people (including ourselves). It was depressing. But it gets worse! The movie was trash. Literally trash. I should’ve went with my gut when the opening scenes started. The quality was garbage. Like the movie was made using a terrible, old iPhone (5 or earlier) or a webcam. About 10 minutes into the movie and all I was thinking was if we should leave and sneak into another movie showing, because this movie IS NOT worth my money. It really wasn’t. I regret not making the suggestion. I was hoping it would pick up, since it was moving glacially, but nothing. Slow as all hell. Terrible acting. Potentially as bad as <em>The Room</em>. Maybe worse, considering that <em>The Room</em> was funny as well as terrible. But this movie? No…it wasn’t even funny. I tried to rationalize it, but it really was just dreadful. The entire thing. It picked up dramatically in the end, but still awful. It was worse than those old horror movies that are not even scary, despite their bad incorporation of visual/special effects.</p>

<p>I liked that they touched on the potential PTSD of victims of stalking/rape, but I think it could have been discussed further. Even the commentary on insurance fraud, and maybe even big pharma could have been interesting to delve into… I understand that the aesthetic of the movie may have been purposeful, but it just made me want to leave my seat and demand my money back. I do think the shots used were artistic enough, but I just can’t. My girl and I were able to talk throughout the movie and predict what would happen next with ease…no twist or plot growth. I can see this movie as being a film experiment, since the story felt nonexistent to me. If I were viewed as a critic on rating sites, like Rotten Tomatoes…it’d get a 1 or 1.5 from me.</p>

<p>My movie commentary on <em>Unsane</em> was made without prior research or investigation on the director or writer. I suppose I’ll look up the reviews and purpose another time. I am curious about the director’s intentions, but not quite enough that I would rewatch it in the next few months.</p>
