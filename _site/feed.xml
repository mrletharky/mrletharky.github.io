                &lt;p&gt;I’m queer. And the person I’m talking to is sort of out, as bisexual. I say sort of because she’s out to some, but not all. Her family being in the not all category. There are two Instagram accounts that she uses, one is accessible to a few select people (ie. close friends), and the other is for public viewing. I am following both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where the division of expe...

                &lt;p&gt;My Spring Break began at 3pm on Friday, March 23, 2018. It also marked the end of my time as an undergraduate. I was relieved to be finally done, but I was worried at the same time, because I still don’t know what will happen to me. I don’t have a job that will allow me to survive. I don’t want to ask my mom for help, financially. And I still want to learn. There are so many classes I ...

                &lt;p&gt;Ok, I was really hoping not to vent on here (especially so soon), but I’m really frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a quiet person, who typically doesn’t share their opinions unless asked. However, today, when the person I am dating mentioned an instance, in which a mutual friend was being rude and insistent, I was livid! I found out that this friend was asking my girl (she doesn’t k...

                &lt;p&gt;Netflix apparently first released the &lt;em&gt;Chef’s Table&lt;/em&gt; docuseries in 2015. I started watching it today. Literally 3 hours ago. Y’all don’t know how much I love food. Y’all don’t even know how much I love art. So the combination of the two, in regards to the videography of the food itself, touches my soul. Thanks for introducing this series to me, DK.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This web project of mine was first conceived with the idea that I would develop my HTML and CSS skills. Considering that this site is powered by Jekyll, I have also decided to understand the basic workings of it, at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maintain my motivation in improving my technological skills, I have decided to blog about various things that occur in my life. These...
