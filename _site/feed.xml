                &lt;p&gt;Ok, I was really hoping not to vent on here (especially so soon), but I’m really frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a quiet person, who typically doesn’t share their opinions unless asked. However, today, when the person I am dating mentioned an instance, in which a mutual friend was being rude and insistent, I was livid! I found out that this friend was asking my girl (she doesn’t k...

                &lt;p&gt;This web project of mine was first conceived with the idea that I would develop my HTML and CSS skills. Considering that this site is powered by Jekyll, I have also decided to understand the basic workings of it, at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
